[Brief] (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/brief/) is a feed reading extension for Mozilla Firefox, developed by Adam Kowalczyk, and released under the [MPL 1.1] (http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/1.1/ "Mozilla Public License, version 1.1").


About
-----

Because of the UI changes brought by its major release 1.6 (a regression in usability, for some people), this **independent fork** does the old Brief 1.5.4 compatible with more recent Firefox releases. Some minor enhancements landed too. 

It's all shared under the [MPL 2.0] (http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/ "Mozilla Public License, version 2.0").

Note that because the [changes brought by Firefox 22] (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=834457), the compatibility was broken in a hard way and the **development was dropped**.
